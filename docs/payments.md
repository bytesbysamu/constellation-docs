Constellation integrates with **Stripe** to handle both **subscriptions** and **one-time payments**. This makes it easy to manage payments for your SaaS application with comprehensive payment processing capabilities.

---

## **Stripe Integration Overview**

Constellation supports **Stripe** out of the box, enabling easy management of customer subscriptions and one-time payments. The integration is built with security and scalability in mind.

### **Key Features**
- **Subscription Management**: Automated recurring billing
- **One-time Payments**: Single purchase transactions
- **Customer Portal**: Self-service billing management
- **Webhook Integration**: Real-time payment event processing
- **Secure Processing**: PCI-compliant payment handling

---

## **Setup and Configuration**

### **API Keys Configuration**
You can get your Stripe API keys by logging into your Stripe account and navigating to the [API keys section](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys). Use the **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key** and set them up as environment variables for security and configuration purposes.

```bash
# Required environment variables
STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY=sk_test_...  # Secret key for backend
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY=whsec_...  # Webhook secret for verification
```

### **Environment Configuration**
```yaml
stripe:
  private-key: '${STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY}'
  webhook-secret-key: '${STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY}'
```

---

## **Webhook Configuration**

Webhooks are used to listen to Stripe events like payment success, subscription updates, etc. To set up a webhook:

1. Go to the **Webhooks** section in your Stripe dashboard.
2. Add a new webhook with the endpoint URL:  
   `http://localhost:8081/api/webhook/` (Development)
   `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhook/` (Production)
3. Subscribe to the following events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
   - `invoice.paid`

### **Webhook Security**
- **Signature Verification**: All webhooks are verified using Stripe's signature
- **Secret Validation**: Webhook secrets are validated for each request
- **Event Processing**: Secure event handling with proper error management

    // Subscription creation
    public CheckoutSession createCheckoutSession(CheckoutSessionRequest request) {
        // Implementation details
    }
    
    // Customer portal
    public String createCustomerPortalSession(String customerId, String returnUrl) {
        // Implementation details
    }
}
```

### **Webhook Handler**
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/webhook")
public class WebhookController {
    
    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleWebhook(
        @RequestHeader("Stripe-Signature") String signature,
        @RequestBody String payload
    ) {
        // Verify webhook signature
        // Process webhook events
        // Return appropriate response
    }
}
```

### **Data Models**
```java
public interface SubscriptionResponse {
    String currentPlan();
    long expiryDate();
    String status();
    long freeTrialExpiryDate();
}

public interface CheckoutSessionRequest {
    String priceId();
    String returnUrl();
